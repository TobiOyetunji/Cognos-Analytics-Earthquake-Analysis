# Introduction
This study examines a dataset of earthquakes documented globally by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from July 27 to August 25, 2016. The collection has 8,394 records, each with 17 attributes pertaining to earthquakes, including magnitude, depth, significance, and geographical location. The investigation seeks to identify patterns in earthquake frequency, magnitude, and significance, utilizing IBM Cognos Analytics to generate visualizations, predictive models, and dashboards.

# Statement of the Problem
Earthquakes present a substantial risk to life and infrastructure, rendering their research essential for disaster preparedness and mitigation. This research aims to investigate questions including: - What patterns manifest in seismically active areas?
- Are certain regions more prone to significant or high-magnitude earthquakes?
- What deficiencies are present in sensor coverage, and how may they be rectified to enhance data precision?

# Objective of the Project
The principal objective of this project is to examine earthquake data to discern patterns and connections, employing visual and predictive methods to yield insights into earthquake behavior on both global and regional scales.

# Methodology
1. Data Preparation: Examine, sanitize, and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine and visualize the dataset to discern trends, patterns, and distributions.
3. Predictive Modeling: Develop decision tree models that forecast earthquake importance and magnitude utilizing variables such as location, distance, and gap.
4. Dashboard Development: Create interactive dashboards and a narrative to graphically convey insights.
5. Insights & Recommendations: Consolidate findings to provide actionable applications and avenues for additional research.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset was pristine, necessitating little modifications: 
- Outliers in significance and negative depths were rectified.
- Geographical patterns of earthquake activity were observed.
- A correlation study revealed robust correlations between magnitude and significance, further augmented by the inclusion of distance and gap.

# Principal visualizations comprise 
- Frequency distribution of earthquakes categorized by magnitude.
- Heatmaps illustrating areas of elevated earthquake activity.
- Maps identifying earthquake sites, highlighting fault lines and irregularities.

# Key Insights 
- The frequency of earthquakes diminishes with increasing magnitude, as little earthquakes substantially outnumber major ones.
- Significance is not exclusively determined by magnitude; variables such as population density also influence it.
- Certain areas, including Oklahoma and Kansas, demonstrate unanticipated seismic activity, potentially associated with anthropogenic operations such as fracking.
- Sensor coverage is inconsistent, necessitating enhanced monitoring in certain regions to augment data accuracy.

# Suggestions
1. Augmented Surveillance: Implement supplementary sensors in inadequately watched areas to enhance data dependability.
2. Disaster Preparedness: Allocate resources to areas characterized by significant earthquake risk and high population density.
3. Further Research: Examine the correlation between anthropogenic activity and seismic anomalies, particularly in regions such as Oklahoma.
4. Tool Adoption: Employ interactive dashboards to obtain real-time insights for company or governmental decision-making.

# Summary
This study demonstrates the efficacy of IBM Cognos Analytics in extracting meaningful insights from seismic data. By integrating comprehensive visualizations, predictive analytics, and interactive dashboards, stakeholders may make informed decisions to reduce earthquake risks.
